RAG-based chatbot developed during internship at Wexdi Software Solutions using LlamaIndex, FAISS, and LLMs like GPT/Llama 2 for document-aware conversations.

# 🤖 RAG-Based Chatbot using LlamaIndex

This project was developed as part of my internship at **Wexdi Software Solutions**.  
It focuses on building a chatbot that uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture with **LlamaIndex** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to generate context-aware responses from documents.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To create an intelligent chatbot that can fetch relevant information from indexed documents and generate accurate responses using an LLM such as GPT or Llama 2.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- 📄 **Document Processing**: Parses and indexes various formats like PDF, Word, and text files.
- 🔍 **Semantic Search**: Uses FAISS or ChromaDB for fast and relevant document retrieval.
- 🧠 **LLM Integration**: Generates natural language responses using models like GPT, Llama 2, or Claude.
- 💬 **Chat Interface**: Built with Flask or Streamlit for a user-friendly experience.
- 🗃️ **Memory & Logging**: Tracks user queries and chatbot responses for improved interaction.
